# My solution to Pintos Threads Project

Pintos is an instructional operating system, complete with documentation and ready-made, modular projects that introduce students to the principles of multi-programming, scheduling, virtual memory, and file systems.<br>
In this project, the PintOS project1 (on threads ) is chosen. PintOS comes with a minimally functional thread system. The task undertaken in this project is to extend the functionality of this system to gain a better understanding of threads and synchronization problems. It includes improving the code for alarm clock, priority scheduling and multilevel feedback scheduling. The code primarily deals with modification in the threads directory, with some work in the devices directory on the side. In this implementation, Pintos is run in a system simulator QEMU. The system is installed on Ubuntu 16.4 platform.
